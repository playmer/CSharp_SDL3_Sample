# CSharp_SDL3_Sample

```
git clone --recurse-submodules -j8 https://github.com/playmer/CSharp_SDL3_Sample.git
```

You'll need to go download a build of SDL3, I'm using one from fnalibs-dailies, since it's what the FNA folks who wrote the binding library use:

It needs to be placed next to the csharp executable after building, which for me is `bin/Debug/net8.0`.

That can probably be streamlined, but I'm not much of a C# person, and have limited time to kick the tires omn this.
